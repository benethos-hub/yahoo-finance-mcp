"""Fail a release whose tag is not the package version.

The tag and the version are written in two places. A tag v0.7.0 on a commit
whose pyproject.toml still says 0.6.1 made PyPI refuse the upload, while the
image job pushed 0.7.0, 0.7 and latest with the old code. Run by both publish
jobs before anything is built. GITHUB_REF_NAME holds the tag on a release.
